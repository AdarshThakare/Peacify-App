 # ->Our project uses Firebase Authentication to validate the users (students & counsellors)  on the basis of their valid college email ID.
 # ->Firebase Authentication aims to make building secure authentication easy, while improving the sign-in and onboarding experience for our end users.
 # ->Using Firebase allows us to avoid any fraudulent or fake sign-ins which could potentially lead to a unsatisfactory user experience and lead to exploitation of the platform. Firebase solves this problem.

## ->Community Feed

 # ->Dedicated feed for users where they can share their daily experiences, each feed having a “like” button and feature to delete their post .
 # ->When a student will update the feed by adding a new post, a push notification will be generated using Microsoft Azure.
## Memes
 # ->Students can also share the meme they are interested in via any messaging platform and increase traction.
